\chapter{\label{ch:threads}Threads and Execution}

\section{Threads}
\label{sec:threads}

seL4 provides threads to represent an execution context and manage
processor time. A thread is represented in seL4 by its thread control block
object (\obj{TCB}). Each \obj{TCB} has an associated CSpace (see
\autoref{ch:cspace}) and VSpace (see \autoref{ch:vspace}) which
may be shared with other threads. A \obj{TCB} may also have an IPC buffer
(see  \autoref{ch:ipc}), which is used to pass extra arguments during IPC
or kernel object invocation that do not fit in the architecture-defined message
registers. While it is not compulsory that a thread has an IPC buffer,
it will not be able to perform most kernel invocations, as they require
cap transfer.
Each thread belongs to exactly one security domain (see
\autoref{sec:domains}).
%FIXME: there is much more information held in the TCB!

\subsection{Thread Creation}
\label{sec:thread_creation}

Like other objects, \obj{TCB}s are created with the
\apifunc{seL4\_Untyped\_Retype}{untyped_retype} method (see
\autoref{sec:kernmemalloc}). A newly created thread is initially inactive. It
is configured by setting its CSpace and VSpace with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace}
or \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} methods and then calling
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} with an initial stack pointer and instruction
pointer. The thread can then be activated either by setting the
\texttt{resume\_target} parameter in the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} invocation to true
or by seperately calling the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Resume}{tcb_resume} method. In multicore machines, the thread
would be running on TODO.

\subsection{Thread Deactivation}
\label{sec:thread_deactivation}

The \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Suspend}{tcb_suspend} method deactivates a thread.
Suspended threads can later be resumed.
Their suspended state can be retrieved with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_CopyRegisters}{tcb_copyregisters} methods.
They can also be reconfigured and
reused or left suspended indefinitely if not needed. Threads will be
automatically suspended when the last capability to their \obj{TCB} is
deleted.
% an example of which is demonstrated in \nameref{ex:second_thread}.

\subsection{Scheduling}
\label{sec:sched}

seL4 uses a preemptive round-robin scheduler with 256 priority levels.
All threads have a maximum controlled priority (MCP) and a priority, the latter being the effective
priority of the thread.
When a thread creates or modifies a thread (including itself), it can only set the
other thread's priority and MCP to be less than or equal to its own MCP. Thread priority and MCP can be
set with \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetPriority}{tcb_setpriority}, \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetMCPriority}{tcb_setmcpriority} methods.

\subsection{Exceptions}

Each thread has an associated exception-handler endpoint. If the thread
causes an exception, the kernel creates an IPC message with the relevant
details and sends this to the endpoint. This
thread can then take the appropriate action. Fault IPC messages are
described in \autoref{sec:faults}.

In order to enable exception handlers, a capability to the exception-handler
endpoint must exist in the CSpace of the thread that generates the exception.
The exception-handler
endpoint can be set with the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace} or
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} method.
With these methods, a capability address for the exception handler can be associated with a thread.
This address is then used to lookup the handler endpoint when an exception is generated.
Note, however, that these methods make no attempt to check whether an endpoint capability exists at the specified
address in the CSpace of the thread. The capability is only looked up
when an exception actually happens and if the lookup fails then no
exception message is delivered and the thread is suspended indefinitely.

The exception endpoint must have send and grant rights. Replying to the
exception message restarts the thread. For certain exception types, the contents of
the reply message may be used to set the values in the registers of the
thread being restarted.
See \autoref{sec:faults} for details.



\subsection{Message Layout of the Read-/Write-Registers Methods}
\label{sec:read_write_registers}

The registers of a thread can be read and written with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} methods.
For some registers, the kernel will silently mask certain bits or ranges of bits off, and force them to contain certain
values to ensure that they cannot be maliciously set to values that would compromise the running system, or to respect
values that the architecture specifications have mandated to be certain values. On X86, these bits currently are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{EFLAGS}: Bits 1, 3 and 5, TF, Bits 12-31, and IF.
\end{itemize}

The register contents are transferred via the IPC buffer. The IPC buffer locations that registers are copied to/from are given below.

\section{Faults}
\label{sec:faults}

A thread's actions may result in a fault. Faults are delivered to the
thread's exception handler so that it can take the appropriate action.
The fault type is specified in the message label and is one of:
seL4\_Fault\_CapFault, seL4\_Fault\_VMFault, seL4\_Fault\_UnknownSyscall, seL4\_Fault\_UserException, seL4\_Fault\_DebugException,
or seL4\_Fault\_NullFault (indicating no fault occured and this is a normal IPC message).

Fault are delivered in such a way as to imitate a Call from the faulting
thread. This means that to send a fault message the fault endpoint
must have both write and grant permissions.

\subsection{Capability Faults}

Capability faults may occur in two places. Firstly, a capability fault
can occur when lookup of a capability referenced by a
\apifunc{seL4\_Call}{sel4_call} or \apifunc{seL4\_Send}{sel4_send} system call
failed (\apifunc{seL4\_NBSend}{sel4_nbsend} calls on
invalid capabilities silently fail). In this case, the capability
on which the fault occurred may be the capability being invoked or an
extra capability passed in the \texttt{caps} field in the IPC buffer.

Secondly, a capability fault can occur when \apifunc{seL4\_Recv}{sel4_recv} or \apifunc{seL4\_NBRecv}{sel4_nbrecv}
is called on a capability that does not exist, is not an endpoint or notification capability or does not have
receive permissions.

Replying to the fault IPC will restart the faulting thread. The contents of the
IPC message are given in \autoref{tbl:ipc_contents}.\\

\begin{table}[htb]
\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}
\toprule
    \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{ IPC buffer location} \\
\midrule

    Capability address & \ipcbloc{seL4\_CapFault\_Addr} \\

    otherwise) & \ipcbloc{seL4\_CapFault\_InRecvPhase} \\

    \ipcbloc{seL4\_CapFault\_LookupFailureType} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{tbl:ipc_contents}Contents of an IPC message.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Unknown Syscall}
\label{sec:unknown-syscall}

This fault occurs when a thread executes a system call with a syscall
number that is unknown to seL4.
The register set
of the faulting thread is passed to the thread's exception handler so that it
may, for example, emulate the system call if a thread is being
virtualised.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.

\subsection{User Exception}

User exceptions are used to deliver architecture-defined exceptions. For
example, such an exception could occur if a user thread attempted to
divide a number by zero.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.

\subsection{Debug Exception: Breakpoints and Watchpoints}
\label{sec:debug_exceptions}

Debug exceptions are used to deliver trace and debug related events to threads.
Breakpoints, watchpoints, trace-events and instruction-performance sampling
events are examples. These events are supported for userspace threads when the kernel
is configured to include them (when CONFIG\_HARDWARE\_DEBUG\_API is set). Information
on the available hardware debugging resources is presented in the form of the following constants:

\begin{description}
\item[seL4\_NumHWBreakpoints]: Defines the total number of hardware break
registers available, of all types available on the hardware platform. On the ARM
Cortex A7 for example, there are 6 exclusive instruction breakpoint registers,
and 4 exclusive data watchpoint registers, for a total of 10 monitor registers.
On this platform therefore, \texttt{seL4\_NumHWBreakpoints} is defined as 10.
The instruction breakpoint registers will always be assigned the lower API-IDs,
and the data watchpoints will always be assigned following them.

Additionally, \texttt{seL4\_NumExclusiveBreakpoints}, \texttt{seL4\_NumExclusiveWatchpoints}
and \texttt{seL4\_NumDualFunctionMonitors}
are defined for each target platform to reflect the number of available
hardware breakpoints/watchpoints of a certain type.

\item[seL4\_NumExclusiveBreakpoints]: Defines the number of hardware registers
capable of generating a fault \textbf{only} on instruction execution. Currently this will be
set only on ARM platforms. The API-ID of the first exclusive breakpoint is given
in \texttt{seL4\_FirstBreakpoint}. If there are no instruction-break exclusive
registers, \texttt{seL4\_NumExclusiveBreakpoints} will be set to \texttt{0} and
\texttt{seL4\_FirstBreakpoint} will be set to -1.

\item[seL4\_NumExclusiveWatchpoints]: Defines the number of hardware registers
capable of generating a fault \textbf{only} on data access. Currently this will be set only
on ARM platforms. The API-ID of the first exclusive watchpoint is given
in \texttt{seL4\_FirstWatchpoint}. If there are no data-break exclusive
registers, \texttt{seL4\_NumExclusiveWatchpoints} will be set to \texttt{0} and
\texttt{seL4\_FirstWatchpoint} will be set to -1.

\item[seL4\_NumDualFunctionMonitors]: Defines the number of hardware registers
capable of generating a fault on either type of access -- i.e, the register
supports both instruction and data breaks. Currently this will be set only on
x86 platforms. The API-ID of the first dual-function monitor is given
in \texttt{seL4\_FirstDualFunctionMonitor}. If there are no dual-function break
registers, \texttt{seL4\_NumDualFunctionMonitors} will be set to \texttt{0} and
\texttt{seL4\_FirstDualFunctionMonitor} will be set to -1.

\end{description}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Value sent} & \textbf{IPC buffer location} \\
\midrule
\reg{Breakpoint instruction address} & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[0]} \\
\reg{Exception reason} & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[1]} \\
\reg{Watchpoint data access address} & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[2]} \\
\reg{Register API-ID} & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[3]} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{tbl:debug_exception_result}Debug fault message layout. The
register API-ID is not returned in the fault message from the kernel on
single-step faults.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Debug Exception: Single-stepping}
\label{sec:single_stepping_debug_exception}

The kernel provides support for the use of hardware single-stepping of userspace
threads when configured to do so (when CONFIG\_HARDWARE\_DEBUG\_API is set). To
this end it exposes the invocation, \texttt{seL4\_TCB\_ConfigureSingleStepping}.

The caller is expected to select an API-ID that corresponds to
an instruction breakpoint, to use when setting up the single-stepping
functionality (i.e, API-ID from 0 to \texttt{seL4\_NumExclusiveBreakpoints} - 1).
However, not all hardware platforms require an actual hardware breakpoint
register to provide single-stepping functionality. If the caller's hardware platform requires the
use of a hardware breakpoint register, it will use the breakpoint register given to it in \texttt{bp\_num},
and return \texttt{true} in \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed}. If the underlying platform does not need a hardware
breakpoint to provide single-stepping, seL4 will return \texttt{false} in \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed} and
leave \texttt{bp\_num} unchanged.

If \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed} is \texttt{true}, the caller should not
attempt to re-configure \texttt{bp\_num} for Breakpoint or Watchpoint usage until
the caller has disabled single-stepping and released that register, via a subsequent
call to \texttt{seL4\_TCB\_ConfigureSingleStepping}, or a fault-reply with
\texttt{n\_instr} being 0. Setting \texttt{num\_instructions} to \texttt{0}
\textbf{disables single stepping}.

On architectures that require an actual hardware registers to be configured for
single-stepping functionality, seL4 will restrict the number of registers that
can be configured as single-steppers, to one at any given time. The register that
is currently configured (if any) for single-stepping will be the implicit
\texttt{bp\_num} argument in a single-step debug fault reply.

The kernel's single-stepping, also supports skipping a certain number of
instructions before delivering the single-step fault message. \texttt{Num\_instructions}
should be set to \texttt{1} when single-stepping, or any non-zero integer value to skip that many
instructions before resuming single-stepping. This skip-count can also be set in
the fault-reply to a single-step debug fault.

\section{Domains}
\label{sec:domains}

Domains are used to isolate independent subsystems, so as to limit
information flow between them.
The kernel switches between domains according to a fixed, time-triggered
schedule.
The fixed schedule is compiled into the kernel via the constant
\texttt{CONFIG\_NUM\_DOMAINS} and the global variable \texttt{ksDomSchedule}.

A thread belongs to exactly one domain, and will only run when that domain
is active.
The \apifunc{seL4\_DomainSet\_Set}{domainset_set} method changes the domain
of a thread.
The caller must possess a \obj{Domain} cap and the thread's \obj{TCB} cap.
The initial thread starts with a \obj{Domain} cap (see
\autoref{sec:messageinfo}).
